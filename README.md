## Serverless Banking Portfolio Project

### Made by David Richards

## **WIP (Work In Progress)**

## **Early Alpha**

## **Not Production Ready**

## **What this project does**<br>
This project is a learning and portfolio project that revolves around a banking app in functionality. The basic functions such as creating an account, making deposits and transactions are implimented. The data generated by these operations are then available for data science. There is a cloud microservices implimentation and a local implimentation. The cloud version uses DynamoDB. The local version uses MySQL. The use of SQL not only allows for relational DB magic, but porting to Apache Spark for big data practice.

### Sample Network graph
Vertexes are users<br>
Edges are transactions with direction<br>
Created with Python and Networkx from Gojenga DBs
Using Networkx enables value from the whole field of graph theory
